IP addresses and subnet masks are binary (1s and 0s) and each subnet needs a certain number of **bits** for hosts. The formula is shown below, however subtracting 2 for the network and broadcast address: ![alt text](../snaps/Capture9.1.PNG).

The **subnet mask** is a 32-bit number used to divide an IP address into the network part and the host part.

For each of the 6 subnets given in this labguide, I will be showing the IP allocation of each subnet and the subnet masking.

## **Subnet1: Finance (50 hosts)**

## **Subnet2: Human Resources (30 hosts)**

## **Subnet5: IT (100 hosts)**

## **Subnet6: Operations (80 hosts)**

# Future Growth:
Expanding existing subnets and also adding new subnet. I will be expanding both the finance and operations department. And then i will be adding a new subnet for the legal department. The legal department is not a large department, it only comprises of 20 available hosts.

I will expand finance department from 64 to 120 available host. And also the operations departmnet from 80 to 110 hosts.
